I am an accomplished multi-disciplined creative with a vast range of experience.  Currently situated in Whangarei, New Zealand I am working with a range of clients in different locations throughout New Zealand.  

For the previous six years I have gained valuable experience in web design and front-end development, graphic design, video production and editing.  

Graduating from one of the most sought after creative universities in the southern hemisphere, Media Design School, I am working with clients to create outstanding products.   Products that are both graphically attractive but functional to meet my clients needs. 

My passion of UI / UX design and front end development ensures that websites and digital media created by myself are aesthetically pleasing to the viewer but easy to navigate for multi-generational use. 

I am honoured to have worked with clients creating their brand identity,  Listening to the needs of my clients to ensure the results are just as they imagined, whilst pushing the boundaries in design to share alternative possibilities. 

Supporting a diverse range of businesses, managing their social media marketing campaigns and building their social media profile to connect with existing and new clients is another area of expertise. 

Alternatively, I am a keen photographer who enjoys telling stories through powerful images,  I have experience in photography for various projects, plus digital video and photography editing.
