portfolioDescription: >-
  This design was a concept piece I did to share with my Instagram followers and
  to try a new "Clean-Brutalism" style which is often an oxymoron.  This design
  is for a urban streetwear fashion boutique for a male demographic between 16 &
  30 and by the choice of layout, typography and colour, this design achieved
  that.

  This design pushed the boundaries of modern design, something I aim to do with
  every project.
