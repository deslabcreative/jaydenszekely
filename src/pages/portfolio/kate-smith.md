  In 2017, Kate came to me needing a logo and a business card designed for her
  new marriage celebrant business.  Kate wanted something minimal yet functional
  and appropriate for a wide range of celebrant services including funerals. 
  The design needed to be sensitive for every occasion and be uplifting whilst
  professional. After a series of concepts, we settled on this design as it
  encompassed all these elements.
